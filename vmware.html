    <h2 class="content-h2">Market Context</h2>
    <p class="content-body">VMware operates at the foundation of modern enterprise IT. The server virtualization market it dominates is worth ~$8B annually, but the broader cloud infrastructure market it competes in exceeds $200B.

  <h2 class="content-h2">Product Portfolio</h2>
  <p class="content-body">Post-acquisition, Broadcom dramatically simplified VMware's product portfolio — from 168 SKUs down to 4 core bundles. The strategy: eliminate complexity, force upgrades to flagship, maximize revenue per account.</p>

    <h2 class="content-h2">Who It Serves</h2>
    <p class="content-body">VMware has always had a dual-audience challenge: the IT administrators who live in vCenter every day, and the CIOs who sign multi-million dollar ELAs. Post-Broadcom, this tension has reached a breaking point — the admins are furious, the executives are calculating switching costs.</p>

  <h2 class="content-h2">Value Proposition</h2>
  <p class="content-body">VMware's original value prop — run more workloads on less hardware with more flexibility — remains valid. What Broadcom has changed is the commercial proposition: from "essential infrastructure at reasonable cost" to "irreplaceable infrastructure at maximum extractable price."</p>
  <div class="data-grid">
    <div class="data-cell"><div class="data-label">Functional Value</div><div class="data-value">Still best-in-class — no true replacement exists</div><div class="data-sub">No competing hypervisor matches vSphere's full feature set, stability record, or tooling ecosystem built over 25 years of enterprise deployment.</div></div>
    <div class="data-cell"><div class="data-label">Emotional Value</div><div class="data-value">Severely eroded under Broadcom</div><div class="data-sub">VMware was a beloved brand among sysadmins.

    <div class="data-cell"><div class="data-label">Economic Value</div><div class="data-value">Increasingly questioned as prices rise 8x–15x</div><div class="data-sub">Customers who could justify the old pricing are now running ROI analyses on migration to Nutanix, Azure Stack HCI, or public cloud workload migration.</div></div>

    <h2 class="content-h2">Business Model</h2>
    <p class="content-body">The Broadcom playbook is a masterclass in monetizing irreplaceable enterprise software. Perpetual licenses eliminated. All products moved to subscription. Pricing shifted to per-core with a minimum floor that dramatically inflates bills for large deployments.</p>

<!-- LAYER 9 — PM LENS -->

  <div class="pm-lens-inner">
    <div class="layer-label">Layer 09 · Original Thinking</div>
    <h2 class="content-h2">Observations from my PM Lens</h2>
    <p class="pm-lens-sub">If I were handed VMware as a PM tomorrow — inside Broadcom — here is where I would focus my first 90 days. These are my original observations, grounded in the evidence above.</p>
    <div class="pm-cards">
      <div class="pm-card">
        <div class="pm-card-tag">① The Cut List — What I Would Deprioritize</div>
        <div class="pm-card-title">Stop Investing in the Legacy vSphere Standard SKU</div>
        <p class="pm-card-body">The vSphere Standard tier serves smaller customers Broadcom has explicitly decided not to prioritize. Continuing to maintain and support it creates operational overhead without strategic return. Resources should be redirected entirely to VCF feature development and the Global 2000 migration experience. Sunsetting Standard with a clear migration path to VVF or VCF is cleaner than slow neglect.</p>
        <div class="pm-card-evidence">Evidence: Partner ecosystem reduction signals Broadcom's intent. Standard is the lowest-revenue, highest-support-cost tier.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="pm-card">
        <div class="pm-card-tag">② The Fix List — What I Would Improve</div>
        <div class="pm-card-title">Redesign the Renewal Communication Journey</div>
        <p class="pm-card-body">The current experience is: customers receive a renewal quote and are shocked by the number. There is no proactive education, no simulation tool, no staged negotiation framework. I would redesign the renewal journey to start 6 months before expiry — with usage reports, cost modelling, and a dedicated CSM touchpoint. The goal: make the number feel earned, not imposed. Success metric: reduction in renewal cycle length and decrease in last-minute escalations to executive level.</p>
        <div class="pm-card-evidence">Evidence: Customer complaint patterns consistently cite "surprise" as the primary frustration — not price alone.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="pm-card">
        <div class="pm-card-tag">③ The Build List — What I Would Create</div>
        <div class="pm-card-title">Build a VCF ROI Dashboard — In-Product</div>
        <p class="pm-card-body">Customers who are forced onto VCF need to see its value reflected back at them continuously. I would build an in-product ROI dashboard that shows: infrastructure consolidation savings, security incident prevention metrics, and operational hours saved vs. a disaggregated tooling approach. This transforms VCF from "expensive bundle" to "investment with measurable return" — arming the IT admin to defend renewal to the CFO.</p>
        <div class="pm-card-evidence">Evidence: 80M cores committed means large customers are in — but they need internal justification tools to stay.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="pm-card">
        <div class="pm-card-tag">④ Pricing &amp; GTM Gut Check</div>
        <div class="pm-card-title">Introduce a Multi-Year Discount Ladder with Commitments</div>
        <p class="pm-card-body">The current model maximizes short-term extraction but incentivizes annual churn evaluation. I would introduce a meaningful multi-year commitment discount — 15% for 2 years, 25% for 3 years — in exchange for locked core counts. This smooths Broadcom's revenue recognition, reduces annual churn risk, and gives customers a face-saving way to accept higher prices by framing the negotiation around commitment rather than capitulation.</p>
        <div class="pm-card-evidence">Evidence: $30B TCV committed over 3 years shows large customers will commit — they just need a pricing incentive to do so willingly.</div>
