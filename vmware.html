    <p class="content-body">VMware has always had a dual-audience challenge: the IT administrators who live in vCenter every day, and the CIOs/CTOs who sign the multi-million dollar ELAs. Post-Broadcom, this tension has reached a breaking point — the admins are furious, the executives are calculating switching costs.</p>

    <h2 class="content-h2">VALUE PROPOSITION</h2>
    <p class="content-body">VMware's original value prop — run more workloads on less hardware, with more flexibility — remains valid. What Broadcom has changed is the commercial proposition: from "essential infrastructure at reasonable cost" to "irreplaceable infrastructure at maximum extractable price."</p>

    <div class="layer-label">Layer 06 · Business Model</div>
    <h2 class="content-h2">BUSINESS MODEL</h2>
    <p class="content-body">The Broadcom playbook is a masterclass in monetizing irreplaceable enterprise software. They stopped selling perpetual licenses entirely in early 2024, forcing all customers to subscription. Pricing shifted to per-core, with a minimum floor that dramatically inflates bills for large deployments.</p>

        <div class="grid-item-sub">As of early 2024, no new perpetual licenses sold. All products moved to annual or multi-year subscription. Massive increase in recurring revenue predictability.</div>

        <div class="grid-item-value">Per Physical CPU Core — 32-Core Packs Minimum</div>
        <div class="grid-item-sub">Every CPU is counted as at least 16 cores. Cores sold in packs of 32. Large environments with many low-core CPUs face outsized cost increases.</div>

    <h2 class="content-h2">COMPETITIVE MAP</h2>
